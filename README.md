### Lose Yourself

**The title** to this repo is obviously in reference to [Eminem's Song!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s) 

I recently decided to undertake a postgraduate course in Statistics for the next year or 2.

This here is all the R/SAS code that I have and will write over this period coupled with resources used.

It's scrambled and lacks any form of structure.

Lose Yourself in the Code.
