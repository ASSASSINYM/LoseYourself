\paragraph{Introduction:}Statistics is the art of collecting, summarising, presenting and interpreting data about a population of interest. Primarily social statistics involves studying human behavior in a social environment. \\
In social statistics the main areas of study include:-

\begin{itemize}
\item Educational statistics
\item Housing statistics
\item Demoraphy statistics
\item Crime statistics
\item Social security statistics
\item Health statistics
\item Labour statistics
\item Environmental statistics
\item Food and Agricultural statistics  
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Social statistics use in demography:} High dynamic of demographic processes is observed in particular in the beginning of transition period. This dynamics is caused both by political and economic reasons. In some regions dramatic changes of demographic situation is observed.For instance we can be confronted with the following specific phenomena:-
\begin{itemize}
\item Significant dynamic changes of basic vital indicators in first years of transition: decrease of rate of birth, overmortality of men, rapid decrease of rate of marriages, increase of rate of divorces, changes life expectancy, changes of fertility rate etc.)
\item Political migrations: migrations caused by political reasons (e.g. migrations stimulated by introducing new laws on citizenship, on official national language etc.)
\item Economic migrations: economic disturbances in first years of transition have caused economic international migrations: permanent, long term, short term and periodical.
\item Refugees: permanent, long term, short term and periodical migrations caused by military actions.
\item Ethnic re-emigration: after the creation of new independent states ethnic migrations of people to their ethnic states.
\item Migrations caused by disasters: natural, ecological.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Social Statistics in this case is use to give vital information on the demographic structure, population size and other key indicators which can be grouped based on civil status, ethnicity, religion,
education, profession, and economic activity - employment, housing conditions.This in turn enables the government in planning and resource allocation based on the social data.\\

\noindent\textbf{Social statistics use in housing:}The specific phenomena here includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes in housing conditions of population caused by market economy and cuts of government subsidies (significant increase of the share of rents for flats in family budgets).
\item Substance of housing: in some regions political disturbances (including military actions) cause losses in the quantity and quality substance ofhousing.
\item Regionally concentrated migrations caused by housing conditions.
\item Consequences of demographic process (rate of births, marriages, divorces, migrations) on housing situation.
\item Homelessness.
\item Commercialization and privatization of housing and its social and economic consequences for households (change of income for disposal, negative income for disposal etc.)
\end{itemize}  
\noindent This is used to estimate the homeless population by regions, with special reference to urban
areas and big cities, social structure of homeless people, Level and dynamics of rents for flats and their share in incomes of households and development of dwelling market (prices of flats, rents for flats ratio of the price to the average income and salary). The data are necessary to evaluate the mobility
of labor force in the country. \\

\noindent\textbf{Social statistics use in labour:}The specific phenomena here includes the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Shadow and ill-registered employment and self-employment.
\item Incidental, unstable, short time and part time employment.
\item Unemployment generated by the processes of the restructuring of industry.
\item Many, relatively small, relatively isolated, autonomous local labor markets, i.a. because of underdevelopment of modern commuting infrastructure, high costs of flats on free market and the structure of urbanization of the country ("onefactory dependent" towns).
\item Underdevelopment of administrative infrastructure organizing labor markets and unemployment.
\end{itemize}  
\noindent This is used to generate a statistical map of local labor markets to help the governments to evaluate the situation on regional and local labor markets and to chose most effective measures to preventing and fighting against unemployment and its social consequences,validation and quality control of data on employment and jobs collected directly form businesses  and estimate the costs of labor for employers. \\

\noindent\textbf{Social statistics use in health:}The specific phenomena here includes the following:
